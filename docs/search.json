While the installation of these incinerators marked a significant step forward, their real-world performance, particularly in terms of emissions and air quality, was yet to be critically evaluated.\nThis documentation details the improvements and adaptations introduced to the incinerators between 22 October 2024 and 16 January 2025 during the field work of Raphaël Bahisson, being a part of his Master’s thesis at ETH Zürich.\n\n\n2 Overview\nDocumentation of the construction of two initial incinerators is available here. The work detailed in this repository and the underlying thesis address the challenges in the construction, visible through material degradation and combustion efficiency deterioration, after one year of operation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Clogged cyclone separator and chimney causing the smoke to evacuate through all cracks.\n\n\nDuring initial testing, it became apparent that the cyclone separator, too small a chimney and cracks in the construction did not provide satisfactory conditions for complete combustion and became a bottleneck in the design, making the operation of the incinerators unbearable to the operators, questioning project’s relevance.\nTo address the above issues, the cracks, brickwork, cement, and broken metal parts were fixed. Two 4 m-long, 160 mm-wide chimneys were installed on two incinerators (one at the Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic and one at Sustainable Cape Maclear) to increase the airflow and draft efficiency. A copper pipe heat exchanger was added to both incinerators to recuperate waste heat from the fume gases and provide the all-year-round access to warm water without additional fuel, offering environmental and practical benefits for the clinic and worker hygiene. In the end, a waste sorting table and an adjacent lift for trash cans at Sustainable Cape Maclear were installed to incentivize waste sorting and organized waste management. The total cost of the work (repairs, improvements, and adaptations, not including student’s labor) is $1301.63 USD. Details about all adaptations and their costs are provided on the following pages of this repository.\n\n\n3 Safety Precautions\nAlways wear protective equipment when working with heat and waste. A mask, goggles, gloves and closed footwear are essential for protecting the operator’s health.\n\n\n4 License\nThe complete design and user manual are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 1. Waste being unloaded on the waste sorting table using the lift.\n\n\nIn an effort to improve the waste management practices at Cape Maclear and optimize waste processing ahead of incineration, a waste sorting table and a manually operated lift were implemented. These constructions aimed to facilitate proper waste segregation, enhance operational efficiency, and reduce worker fatigue, ultimately contributing to a more structured and sustainable waste management system.\n\n1 Waste sorting table\nThe waste sorting table was designed to provide a systematic approach to separating waste before incineration. The table was built from locally available metal, ensuring long-term usability and resilience in field conditions. It consists of:\n\nA flat surface with incline to facilitate the movement of waste towards designated sorting bins.\nFour categorized sections of the following types:\n\nWaste for incineration (materials suitable for burning).\nGlass (set aside for proper disposal).\nBatteries (collected separately due to hazardous material handling regulations).\nCompost (organic waste segregated for decomposition and soil enrichment).\n\n\nWith integration of the table in the waste management workflow the workers could more efficiently categorize waste before disposal, reducing non-combustible material within the incinerated waste, improving burning efficiency, and minimizing emissions.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Four waste sections on the sorting table.\n\n\n\n\n2 Trash bin lift\nTo assist in lifting and loading waste onto the sorting table, a manually operated pulley system on a frame was developed. Given the financial and infrastructure limitations, the design used readily available components and simple mechanical principles:\n\nPulley System mounted on a 2 m-high frame, allowing for vertical lifting of waste bins.\nRope Mechanism: sourced from local fishermen, strong and durable rope was used to lift the bins.\nTilting function: the bin, when lifted, tilted forward to empty its contents onto the sorting table without requiring heavy manual lifting.\n\nThis lifting mechanism lifting mechanism significantly reduces physical strain on workers and streamlines the waste processing workflow, making it easier and more efficient to transfer waste from collection bins to the sorting table, incentivizing waste separation.\n\n\n3 Costs\nTo ensure consistency across reporting, all the cost calculations were converted from MWK to USD with an exchange rate of 2,000 MWK/USD.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Waste Sorting Table construction costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDetails\nPrice (MWK)\nPrice (USD)\n\n\n\n\nMetal plates\n2 plates: 120 cm × 210 cm\n505,000\n252.50\n\n\nSquare profiles\n2 profiles: 40 mm × 40 mm, 1.6 mm, 6 m\n100,000\n50.00\n\n\nAngle profile\n1 profile: 50 mm × 50 mm, 6 m\n20,000\n10.00\n\n\nWelding\n-\n100,000\n50.00\n\n\nTotal\n-\n725,000\n362.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Construction costs for the lift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDetails\nPrice (MWK)\nPrice (USD)\n\n\n\n\nRope\n5 m\n20,000\n10.00\n\n\nAngle profiles\n3 profiles: 50 mm × 50 mm, 6 m\n50,000\n25.00\n\n\nSquare profiles\n2 profiles: 40 mm × 40 mm, 1.6 mm, 6 m\n278,000\n139.00\n\n\nGate Tyre\n-\n27,500\n13.75\n\n\nWelding\n-\n100,000\n50.00\n\n\nTotal\n-\n475,500\n237.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Operation\nTo ensure smooth and efficient waste processing, the following operational steps should be followed:\n\nWaste collection & transport\n\nWaste is collected from designated bins placed around the village and transported to the sorting table.\n\nLifting waste using the lift\n\nThe worker secures the waste bin using the rope and the pulley system.\nBy pulling the opposite end of the rope, the bin is lifted and tilted forward, allowing its contents to be emptied onto the sorting table.\nThe bin is lowered and placed back in its designated area.\n\nSorting process\n\nWorkers manually separate waste into the designated categories.\nFinal waste disposal: properly sorted incinerable waste is transferred to the incinerator for burning, while the non-combustible and recyclable materials are stored appropriately for future disposal and/or reuse.\n\n\n\n\n5 Impact and Performance Evaluation\nThe introduction of the waste sorting table and lifting mechanism results in multiple benefits, both operational and environmental:\n\nIncreased sorting accuracy: proper segregation of waste improved combustion efficiency by reducing the presence of non-combustible materials.\nReduction in air pollution: by ensuring only suitable materials are incinerated, emissions from burning are significantly reduced.\nEnhanced worker safety and efficiency: the lifting mechanism minimizes heavy lifting, reducing the risk of injuries and making waste handling more manageable.\nCleaner waste processing environment: the structured approach to waste sorting created a more organized and hygienic waste disposal area."

    "title": "Adaptations to incinerators",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The objectives of this work were twofold: assess the environmental and operational impact of the incinerators—especially their effect on local air quality—and implement targeted improvements to the design and functionality. This document outlines the specific adaptations introduced to two incinerators–one located at the Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic and one at the Sustainable Cape Maclear waste deposit site–and presents the measurable results the changes had on emissions and overall system efficiency.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Finished, improved version of the incinerator at Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic in Cape Maclear, Malawi.\n\n\n\n1 Summary of Main Technical Adaptations\nBased on the initial assessment of two incinerators, which construction is detailed here, several key issues were identified after one year of operation. The issues limited the performance and posed environmental and health risks to the operators. To address them, a series of technical adaptations aimed at improving combustion efficiency, structural durability, and user safety are proposed:\n\nStructural reinforcement. Cracks and weak points in the combustion chambers were repaired and re-cemented. Several damaged bricks were replaced, improving heat retention and the structural longevity of the system.\nChimney enlargement and extension. The original chimneys (75 mm diameter, 3 m height) restricted airflow and caused excessive smoke buildup. They were replaced with wider and taller chimneys (160 mm diameter, 4 m height), improving draft and allowing for more complete combustion (decreasing particulate matter).\nRemoval of cyclone separator. The initial incinerator’s construction at Sustainable Cape Maclear incorporated a cyclone separator downstream the second combustion chamber. Unfortunately, one year of operation was enough to clog it completely, failing to capture particulate matter and, more importantly, causing the smoke to evacuate though the separator and incinerator’s cracks, but not the chimney. The separator was removed to reduce flow resistance in the exhaust pathway and improve airflow.\nAir vent installation. Additional adjustable air vents were added to the secondary combustion chambers to optimize oxygen intake. This facilitated ignition, enhanced flame stability, and improved the overall burning process.\nRotating chimney cap. A chimney cap was added to both incinerators to direct the smoke upwards, promoting dispersion into the atmosphere and preventing it from settling at ground level. This directly addressed complaints from nearby residents about smoke stains and poor air quality.\nErgonomic loading hatch. The steel handle on the waste loading door was repositioned to the correct side, improving ergonomics and safety during use.\nModified waste loading drum. A halved metal drum with handlebars was introduced as a safe and reusable alternative to plastic bags for waste loading. This solution reduced operational costs and allowed for safe mid-combustion waste insertion.\nSafety fence at the clinic. A chicken wire fence was installed around the clinic’s incinerator to restrict access for third parties, a simple but important addition for the planned opening of a maternity ward nearby.\n\nThese adaptations were designed not only to bring the incinerators closer to the performance standards of those, specified in the documentation of the original De Montfort Mark 8A model, but also to ensure practical usability, safety, and sustainability in the specific context of Cape Maclear.\n\n\n2 Costs of adaptations\nTo ensure consistency across reporting, all the cost calculations were converted from MWK to USD with an exchange rate of 2,000 MWK/USD.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Costs of fixing the existing incinerators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDetails\nPrice (MWK)\nPrice (USD)\n\n\n\n\nCement\nFixing cracks\n137,500\n68.75\n\n\nBricks\nReplacing cracked bricks\n36,000\n18.00\n\n\nSand\nTo mix with cement\n18,000\n9.00\n\n\nBolts & nuts\nM10\n8,000\n4.00\n\n\nTimber wire\n-\n18,000\n9.00\n\n\nLabor\n2 days of work (builder and helper)\n34,000\n17.00\n\n\nChimneys\n8 meters in total, 160 mm diameter\n650,000\n325.00\n\n\nWelding\nChimneys and air vents\n100,000\n50.00\n\n\nTOTAL\nfor two incinerators\n1,001,500\n500.75\n\n\nTotal per incinerator\n-\n500,750\n250.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Waste sorting & ash management\nTo reduce emissions and improve combustion efficiency by incinerating only the desired material, a basic waste sorting system was introduced. Additionally, an ash pit was built at the waste deposit site for safer ash disposal, and a simple chicken-wire filter was constructed to remove the non-ash residues before storage.\n\n\n4 Incinerator Performance Improvements\nThe modifications made to both incinerators led to clear and measurable improvements in combustion efficiency and structural performance:\n\nHigher Combustion Temperatures. After the interventions, the maximum combustion temperatures increased from 663°C to 846°C at the Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic and from 372°C to 907°C at Sustainable Cape Maclear. These temperature gains indicate more complete and stable combustion, theoretically decreasing the concentration of dioxins.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Combustion temperature in the primary combustion chamber, calculated as a mean of three measurement points for three stages. Stage 1 indicates the combustion temperature before the adaptations were introduced, while stage 3 data shows mean combustion temperature after all improvements described above.\n\n\n\nReduced Waste-to-Ash ratio (W2A). The amount of unburnt solid waste is represented by the Waste-to-Ash ratio. After adaptations to the incinerators, W2A dropped considerably, reflecting better fuel utilization. At the clinic W2A dropped from 22.1% to 10.2% and at waste deposit, from 39.4% to 17.1%.\nImproved airflow and structural integrity. Larger chimney and added air vents led to increased airflow and easier incinerator’s ignition. Repaired cement and brickwork improved heat retention, while the new chimney cap helped reduce localized smoke buildup. Together, these improvements brought the systems closer to the intended De Montfort Mark 8A incinerator performance standard while ensuring more consistent and cleaner operation in the field.\n\n\n\n5 Air Quality Improvements & Measurements\nA central goal of this project was to reduce harmful emissions from incineration — particularly the fine particulate matter (PM), which poses significant health risks when inhaled. Throughout the improvement process, the concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 in the vicinity of two incinerators were monitored with a particulate matter monitor. The results demonstrate a significant decrease in airborne pollutants after all modifications were introduced.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Particulate matter measurements at Sustainable Cape Maclear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle size\nConcentration before improvements \\({\\rm [\\mu g/m^3]}\\)\nConcentration after improvements \\({\\rm [\\mu g/m^3]}\\)\n\n\n\n\nPM1.0\n58.13\n8.31\n\n\nPM2.5\n66.13\n10.23\n\n\nPM10\n77.63\n4.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Extrapolated Particulate Matter emissions for the Sustainable Cape Maclear initial incinerator (Stage 1), during improvements (Stage 2), and after all adaptations (Stage 3). Notably, the final version of the incinerator would require burning waste for 16 hours to exceed the WHO moderate limit for PM1.0 emissions (impossible value due to the ash tray capacity).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Particulate matter measurements at Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle size\nConcentration before improvements \\({\\rm [\\mu g/m^3]}\\)\nConcentration after improvements \\({\\rm [\\mu g/m^3]}\\)\n\n\n\n\nPM1.0\n40.12\n3.07\n\n\nPM2.5\n48.34\n3.08\n\n\nPM10\n73.88\n3.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Extrapolated Particulate Matter emissions for the Billy Riordan Clinic initial incinerator (Stage 1&2), and after all adaptations (Stage 3). Notably, the final version of the incinerator would require burning waste for 6 hours to exceed the WHO moderate limit for PM2.5 emissions).\n\n\nAfter the improvements to the incinerators, all PM values fell below the WHO’s recommended 24-hour exposure thresholds, which classify concentrations above 35 µg/m³ for PM1.0 and PM2.5 and above 75 µg/m³ for PM10, as dangerous. In contrast, the initial incinerators emitted as much particulate matter as open burning piles. The final version of the incinerators now emit less particulate matter on average, than it was measured in the air of Cape Maclear.\nThese outcomes validate the technical interventions and demonstrate that small-scale incineration, when properly optimized, can offer a safe and sustainable alternative to uncontrolled waste burning.\n\n\n6 Health & Environmental Impact\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Incinerator after fixes and improvements at Sustainable Cape Maclear.\n\n\nThe upgrades to both incinerators had a noticeable positive effect on the health and safety of workers, clinic staff, and nearby residents.\nBefore improvements, the incinerators produced thick, dark smoke due to incomplete combustion and poor airflow. Workers frequently reported symptoms like coughing, eye irritation, and shortness of breath — especially at the waste deposit site, where a clogged chimney forced emissions through the cyclone separator at ground level.\nAfter modifications, these health issues were drastically reduced. The workers can load waste without needing masks or eye protection the clinic staff and patients no longer reported indoor smoke or window staining. Finally, the risk of environmental contamination from open ash deposits was mitigated with the introduction of ash pits and better waste sorting.\nIn the wider context, the cleaner incinerators now contribute to overall village air quality improvement, especially when compared to the severe pollution generated by open waste burning. The ability to reduce airborne PM below background levels shows that incineration, when well-designed, can serve not only as a safe disposal method but also as a public health intervention."

    "text": "The water heating systems were installed on two De Montfort Mark 8A incinerators: one at Billy’s Clinic and one at Sustainable Cape Maclear’s waste deposit site. The purpose of these systems is to recover heat from the incineration process and repurpose it to heat water for sanitary use, improving resource efficiency while reducing reliance on external energy sources.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Heat exchanger mounted on the incinerator’s chimney heating up water in the barrel.\n\n\nThis page details how the heat exchanger was designed, assembled, and installed, providing step-by-step insights into the construction process, operational principles, and maintenance requirements. By documenting the challenges encountered and the solutions developed, this guide serves as a reference for replicating similar heat recovery systems on other small-scale incinerators, particularly in resource-limited settings where sustainable solutions are essential.\n\n1 Assembly Manual\nThe heat exchanger is a copper pipe coiled around the incinerator chimney, transferring heat to a 210 l plastic drum filled with water. The water heating mechanism relies solely on natural convection and does not required additional work input.\nThe assembly required several key steps:\n\nWinding the copper pipe. The pipe was initially purchased in the form of a coil. To wrap it securely around the chimney, it has to be manually bent to fit the chimney’s external diameters, as closely as possible, so the heat transfer is maximized.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Winding two copper pipes for two incinerators.\n\n\n\nPreventing cracks during bending. Copper pipes are prone to cracking when bent, therefore a precautionary method was used to minimize the risk of damage. Before bending, a mixture of water and soap was poured into the pipe and then frozen using ice cubes in a bucket. The frozen liquid inside helped maintain the pipe’s structural integrity, allowing for it to be bent without collapsing or breaking.\nFixing cracks. In cases where small cracks did appear, a blowtorch was used to seal them to ensure structural integrity for water circulation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Fixing cracks with a blowtorch.\n\n\n\nPositioning the pipes on the chimney. The pipe was wrapped as tightly as possible around the chimney to maximize the heat transfer.\nConnecting the pipes to the water storage system. The ends of the copper pipe were mounted to the 210 l plastic drum that served as the water storage unit. Two holes were drilled into the drum to allow for the water from the pipes to enter and exit the drum. An adhesive sealant was applied around the openings to ensure airtight connection and prevent leaks.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Applying sealant on the water tap; similarly it was applied on the copper pipe-to-drum connections.\n\n\n\nFinal adjustments. To provide insulation and reduce the heat loss (maintaining higher water temperature for extended periods) the drum was covered with a wooden lid. Two taps were drilled into the plastic drum to drain warm at different heights. Two taps are needed if not enough waste is burnt for the entire volume of water to heat up; if this is the case, the water can be drained from the higher tap, relying on introduced temperature gradient in the tank (warmer water stays at the top before it mixes with cold water). Finally, a skimmer made out of steel wire and mosquito net was made to clean the water stored in the plastic drum.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Skimmer for separating waste from water.\n\n\n\n\n2 Costs\nTo ensure consistency across reporting, all the cost calculations were converted from MWK to USD with an exchange rate of 2,000 MWK/USD.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Costs of adding a heat exchanger to one incinerator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDetails\nPrice (MWK)\nPrice (USD)\n\n\n\n\nCopper pipes\n15 meters, 1/2” diameter\n200,000\n100.00\n\n\nPlastic drum\n210 L capacity\n100,000\n50.00\n\n\nTaps\n2 drilled into each drum\n4,000\n2.00\n\n\nSteel wire\n-\n18,500\n9.25\n\n\nLabor\nAssembling & pipe bending\n58,500\n29.25\n\n\nLid\nTo cover the plastic drum\n15,000\n7.50\n\n\nAdhesive\nEnsures air-tightness of the holes\n5,250\n2.61\n\n\nTotal\n-\n401,250\n200.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Operation\nThe heat exchanger operates thanks to thermal convection, using temperature gradient in the tank to naturally circulate water. The process works as follows:\n\nCold water enters the copper pipes from the bottom of the plastic drum.\nAs the incinerator chimney heats up, the copper pipes absorb the heat, heating the water in the pipes.\nNatural convection causes the heated water to rise through the pipes. Hot water exits the pipe at top of the plastic drum, while colder water flows in the copper pipe from the bottom of the drum, maintaining continuous circulation.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions:\n\nThe system takes approximately 40 minutes before the first heated water exits the pipes.\nThe water laving the copper coil reaches a maximum temperature of 70°C.\nStored water inside the drum stabilizes at approximately 45°C, good for sanitary purposes: hand washing and cleaning in the clinic.\nTo ensure that no solid particles contaminate the water, a water skimmer is used to filter out debris before use.\n\n\n\n4 Maintenance\nThe heat exchanger requires minimal maintenance to ensure long-term efficiency. Key maintenance tasks include:\n\nChecking for leaktightness. Regularly inspecting the pipe connections at the drum for any signs of leakage and resealing if necessary.\nCleaning the water skimmer. Ensuring that the skimmer remains free of debris to prevent clogging and maintain water quality.\nInspecting the copper pipes. Monitoring the pipes for cracks or wear, particularly in areas exposed to high heat stress.\nPreventing blockages. Occasionally flushing the pipes with clean water to remove any potential mineral buildup inside.\n\nSince the system operates passively using thermal convection, there are no mechanical parts that require frequent servicing, making it a low-maintenance solution for heat recovery.\n\n\n5 Safety Precautions\nTo ensure safe operation of the heat exchanger, the following precautions should be followed:\n\nPipe handling. When bending copper pipes, always use the water-freezing method to prevent cracks.\nBlowtorch use. If cracks need to be repaired, use the blowtorch carefully and ensure it is handled by trained personnel.\nAvoid drum overheating. The plastic drum should be monitored to ensure it does not exceed its heat tolerance limits.\nProper sealing. The adhesive around pipe openings should be regularly checked to prevent air leaks, which could disrupt the convection process.\nHeat protection. Since the pipes reach high temperatures, operators should wear protective gloves when handling them to avoid burns.\n\nBy following these precautions, the heat exchanger can continue to operate safely and efficiently, providing a reliable supply of warm water for medical and personal use."
