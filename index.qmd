# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This documentation details the improvements introduced to the incinerators constructed in Cape Malcear, Malawi in 2023. The adaptations and improvements took place between 22 October 2024 and 16 January 2025 during field work, being a part of a Master's thesis at ETH Zürich of Raphael Mignot-Bahisson.

# Overview {#sec-overview}

Documentation of the initial incinerator is available [here](https://global-health-engineering.github.io/incinerator-design-cape-maclear/). The work detailed in this repository and the underlying thesis addresses the challenges in the construction, visible through material degradation and combustion efficiency deterioration, after one year of operation.

![Figure 1. Clogged cyclone separator and chimney causing the smoke to evacuate through all cracks.](img/photo/clogged_chimney.jpg){width=80%}

During initial testing, it became apparent that the cyclone separator, too small a chimney and cracks in the construction did not provide satisfactory conditions for complete combustion and became a bottleneck in the design, making the operation of the incinerators unbearable to the operators, questioning project's relevance.

# Part List {#sec-list}

To ensure consistency across reporting, all the cost calculations were converted from MWK to USD with an exchange rate of 2,000 MWK/USD.

# Safety Precautions {#sec-safety}

Always wear protective equipment when working with glass. A mask, goggles, gloves and closed footwear are essential for protecting the operator’s health.
