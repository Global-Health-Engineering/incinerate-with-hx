# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This documentation details the improvements introduced to the incinerators constructed in Cape Malcear, Malawi in 2023. The adaptations and improvements took place between 22 October 2024 and 16 January 2025 during field work, being a part of a Master's thesis at ETH Zürich of Raphael Mignot-Bahisson.

# Overview {#sec-overview}

Documentation of the construction of two initial incinerators is available [here](https://global-health-engineering.github.io/incinerator-design-cape-maclear/). The work detailed in this repository and the underlying thesis address the challenges in the construction, visible through material degradation and combustion efficiency deterioration, after one year of operation.

![Figure 1. Clogged cyclone separator and chimney causing the smoke to evacuate through all cracks.](img/photo/clogged_chimney.jpg){width=50%}

During initial testing, it became apparent that the cyclone separator, too small a chimney and cracks in the construction did not provide satisfactory conditions for complete combustion and became a bottleneck in the design, making the operation of the incinerators unbearable to the operators, questioning project's relevance.

To address the above issues, the cracks, brickwork, cement, and broken metal parts were fixed. Two 4 m-long, 160 mm-wide chimneys were installed to increase the airflow and draft efficiency. A heat exchanger was added to the incinerator constructed at the premisses of Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic to heat water to wash hands and patients. In the end, a waste sorting table and an adjacent lift for trash cans at Sustainable Cape Maclear were installed. The costs of these adaptations are listed in the tables in the next section.

# Part List {#sec-list}

To ensure consistency across reporting, all the cost calculations were converted from MWK to USD with an exchange rate of 2,000 MWK/USD.
